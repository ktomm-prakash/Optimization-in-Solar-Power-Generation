# Optimization-in-Solar-Power-Generation
This project addresses the challenges faced by a leading solar power provider in managing energy output fluctuations caused by environmental variability and system inefficiencies.

- Problem Statement
Client: One of the leading Solar Power Providers

The company faced frequent fluctuations in solar energy output due to:
. Inconsistent environmental conditions (irradiance, temperature, rainfall)
. Inefficiencies in inverter performance
  These issues led to suboptimal power generation and increased operational costs.

- Business Objective
. Maximize power production and performance
. Minimize operational costs
. Improve system efficiency with data-driven insights

- Success Criteria
. Business Success: Achieve a 20â€“30% increase in profit
. Economic Success: Increase revenue by 30% and reduce operational costs by optimizing solar energy generation

- Data Overview
The dataset included:
. Inverter-wise power readings
. Global Irradiance Index (GII)
. Module and ambient temperatures
. Rainfall indicators
. Date/Time of each observation
